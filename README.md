# Information Theoretic Adversarial Approach to Rumour Spread

This repository contains simulation code for the experiments
described in our paper, [rumour spread](rumour_spread.pdf).

## Running the Simulation

## Directories

-   The experiments concerning the original rumour spread model are
    present in the `OriginalModel` directory of this repository.

-   The experiments concerning our modified (directed graph) version 
    of the model are present in the `DirectedGraph` directory of
    this repository.

-   The experiments concerning the measurement of the node and edge
    entropies at steady-state are present in the `NodeAndEdgeInformation`
    directory of this repository.

-   The documents relevant to our experimentation are provided in
    the `Documents` directory of this repository.

-   A faster experimental version of the simulation algorithm is
    present in the `FasterDirectedGraphExperimental` directory
    of this repository.
