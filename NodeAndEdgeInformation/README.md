# NodeAndEdgeInformation

This directory contains the simulation code for the node and edge information
computation, which is described in detail in our paper [rumour spread](../rumour_spread.pdf).

The directory content is described as follows:

-   `graph.py`: This file is the same as [DirectedGraph/graph.py](../DirectedGraph/graph.py), and
    is it is described in detail in [DirectedGraph/README.md](../DirectedGraph/README.md).

-   `scale_free.py`: This file is the same as 
    [DirectedGraph/scale_free.py](../DirectedGraph/scale_free.py), and is it is described in 
    detail in [DirectedGraph/README.md](../DirectedGraph/README.md).

-   `queue_distort.py`: This file is the same as 
    [OriginalModel/queue_distort.py](../OriginalModel/queue_distort.py), and is it is described 
    in detail in [README.md](../OriginalModel/README.md).

-   `memory_queue.py`: This file is the same as 
    [OriginalModel/memory_queue.py](../OriginalModel/memory_queue.py), and is it is described in 
    detail in [OriginalModel/README.md](../OriginalModel/README.md).

-   `prob.py`: This file is the same as [DirectedGraph/prob.py](../DirectedGraph/prob.py), 
    and is it is described in detail in [DirectedGraph/README.md](../DirectedGraph/README.md).

-   `rumour_spread_info_extract.py`: This file contains code for the `RumourSpreadModel` class,
    but this is different from the implementation of `RumourSpreadModel` class in other
    directories of this repository, in that it also features code for computing node entropies and
    edge entropies.

-   `callbacks.py`: This file is the same as [DirectedGraph/callbacks.py](../DirectedGraph/callbacks.py), 
    and is it is described in detail in [DirectedGraph/README.md](../DirectedGraph/README.md).

-   `plot.py`: This file is the same as [OriginalModel/plot.py](../OriginalModel/plot.py), 
    and is it is described in detail in [OriginalModel/README.md](../OriginalModel/README.md).
